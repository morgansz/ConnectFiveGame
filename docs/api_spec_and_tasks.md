## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Main"),
    ("game.py", "Game"),
    ("ui.py", "UI"),
    ("tests/test_game.py", "TestGame"),
    ("tests/test_ui.py", "TestUI")
]
```

The dependencies between the files are as follows:
- main.py depends on game.py and ui.py
- ui.py depends on game.py
- tests/test_game.py depends on game.py
- tests/test_ui.py depends on ui.py

## Task list:

```python
[
    "game.py",
    "ui.py",
    "main.py",
    "tests/test_game.py",
    "tests/test_ui.py"
]
```

The tasks should be done in the following order:
1. Implement game.py
2. Implement ui.py
3. Implement main.py
4. Implement tests/test_game.py
5. Implement tests/test_ui.py

## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
The 'game.py' file contains the implementation of the Connect Five game logic. It includes the Game class, which manages the game state and provides methods for starting the game, making moves, checking for a winner, and displaying the game board.

The 'ui.py' file contains the implementation of the user interface for the Connect Five game. It includes the UI class, which interacts with the Game class to display the game board, prompt the player for moves, and provide game status updates.

The 'main.py' file is the entry point of the CLI version of the Connect Five game. It creates an instance of the UI class and starts the game.

The 'tests/test_game.py' file contains unit tests for the game logic implemented in game.py.

The 'tests/test_ui.py' file contains unit tests for the user interface implemented in ui.py.
