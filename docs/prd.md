## UI Design draft:
The UI design should include the following elements and functions:
- A welcome message with instructions on how to start a new game
- A command line prompt for the player to enter their moves
- A visual representation of the game board
- Clear and concise messages for game status updates (e.g., player turn, winner, draw)
- An option to quit the game at any time

The style should be minimalistic and easy to read, with a clear distinction between the player's piece and the empty spaces on the board. The layout should be organized and aligned, with the game board displayed in a grid format.

## Anything UNCLEAR:
There are no unclear points.
